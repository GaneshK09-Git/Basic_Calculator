Basic Calculator in Python:

This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.

Features:

- Supports the four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Takes two numbers and an operator as input
- Displays the result rounded to 2 decimal places
- Handles invalid operator input

How It Works:

1. The program prompts the user to input an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`)
2. Then, it asks for two numbers.
3. Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding operation.
4. It prints the result rounded to 2 decimal places.

Sample Usage:

```
Enter an operator (+ - / *): *
Enter the 1st number: 12.5
Enter the 2nd number: 2
25.0
```

Note:

This calculator performs only basic operations and does not include advanced error handling (like dividing by zero). It is intended for beginner-level practice.
